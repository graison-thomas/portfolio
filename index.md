### American Express - Default Prediction Kaggle Competition

In this competition machine learning skills are applied to predict credit default. We leverage an industrial scale data set to build a machine learning model that challenges the current model in production. Training, validation, and testing datasets include time-series behavioral data and anonymized customer profile information.
